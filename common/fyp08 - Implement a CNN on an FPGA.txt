Title: Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on an FPGA.

Outcomes:
- Good understanding of CNNs
- Implementation skills using Verilog
- Using FPGAs to design and test digital logic
- Readiness for the embedded systems and AI job market.

Background:
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are being used in more and 
more applications in the world of today. Convolutional neural networks 
are very popular in the image processing applications and they often make
their way in the embedded systems. A convolutional neural network
implemented implemented on an FPGA can be ideal for an embedded system
for image processing because of its faster processing and low power consumption.

Description:
This includes implementing a traditional convolutional neural network on an FPGA
using the Verilog HDL.

Methodology:
One possible approach to implementing the project can be the following roadmap:
- Learn convolutional neural network basiscs
- Implement CNN from scratch in high-level language (C, Python)
- Revision/Introduction to Verilog HDL
- Build simple designs in Verilog and burn and test them on FPGA
- Build matrix multiplication in Verilog and burn and test them on FPGA
- Build a CNN in Verilog and burn and test it on FPGA

Will be helpful if you have:
- Courses like Fundamentals of Logic Design, Computer Organization and Assembly Language, Intro to AI, etc.
- Some familiarity with Verilog HDL
- Interest in machine learning and low-level hardware design.
