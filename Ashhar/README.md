# Ashhar's Progress!

## Implemented CNN using Tensorflow

## Working On CNN using numpy

    1) Added Convolutional Layer
    2) Added Maxpooling (Forward Prop Only)
    3) Tested Forward Prop for Maxpool and Conv
    4) Added Sigmoid Activation Function
    5) Adeed Flatten Layer (For Expansion to ANN)
    6) Tested Sigmoid + Flatten
    7) Completed all forward propogation steps
    8) Visualized the forward propogation steps in jupyter notebook (main.ipynb)
